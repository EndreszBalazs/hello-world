# hello-world
I am Balázs Endrész. A 18 years old Mechatronic Engineering student. I want to be good at it, but it won't be an easy ride. At first, you need to keep the monemntum and do and do and do what yoz have to, otherwise, you need to be very smart. And I can only hope, that I will be. Secondary grammar school was kinder and easier, but it will be a big challenge, the first big step you need to do before getting started the life... really.
